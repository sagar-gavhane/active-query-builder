## The problem

Writing queries with [mysql](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql) is difficult because it doesn't supports ES6 Promise and while working on a personal project I found that same queries are repeated over and over.

## This solution

I have come up with a simple and flexible solution for writing repetitive queries using active query builder. This pattern allows information to be retrieved, inserted, and updated in your database with minimal scripting. In some cases only one or two lines of code are necessary to perform a database action.

## Getting Started

This package is mainly designed for MySQL. It's written in JavaScript, does not require compiling, and is MIT licensed.

```javascript
const ActiveQueryBuilder = require('active-query-builder')

// make connection to your database
const conn = new ActiveQueryBuilder({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'root',
  password: 'root',
  database: 'sandbox',
})

// query method
conn.query('SELECT * FROM person WHERE email=?', ['john@domain.com'])
  .then(({results, fields, query}) => {
    console.log(results) // this is your result
  })

// get method
conn.get('users').then(({results, fields, query}) => {
  console.log(results) // this is your result
})

// get_where method
conn.get_where('users', { 'email': 'john@domain.com' })
  .then(({ results, fields, query }) => {
    console.log(results) // this is your result
  })
```

### Prerequisites
